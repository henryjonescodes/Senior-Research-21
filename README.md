# Trust Response To Anticipatory Software Agents
_Experiment Environment_
Henry Jones, 2021

This experiment explored how trust relationships are built and broken by forcing study subjects to choose between two suggestions made by two agents of varying reliability in a game setting, simulating relative levels of anticipation of future game states. The user was tasked with deciding which suggestion to follow. During the experiment the participant’s choices were logged along with the value of their chosen agent’s suggested move in relation to the opposing agent’s.

This project contains code developed for the game portion of the experiment in service of my senior thesis project at Union College in computer science.
